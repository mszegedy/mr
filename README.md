This hack uses lots of code that other people made. In fact, everything in
patches/ except for patches/bespoke/ was written by someone else. All of the
.asm files say who made them, I think. (tweaks.asm doesn't say; it was
autogenerated and dispensed by smwcentral.net's "Tweaks" page.) Once this hack
is ready for submission, I will compile a list of everyone to credit and put
it here. For now, I only intend to write non-ASM credits in this README.
(There are none at the time of this writing.) If you are not okay with this or
I have failed to credit you in some way, please let me know. It was a mistake
on either count.
